# Home Energy Monitor
Notification Based Energy Monitoring iOS App ðŸš€

This is an iOS app that acts as a GUI for a Smart Energy Meter. It allows users to view their energy consumption in instantaneous and cumulative modes.     
Users are also able to schedule daily notifications that inform them of how much energy they have used up for the day.    
Users can also set a benchmark kilowatthour value where they'll be notified to purchase more energy if their usage ever falls below this value.     

The Settings screen was implemented with SwiftUI using UIHostingViewController
